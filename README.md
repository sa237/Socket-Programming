# Socket-Programming
The repo contains two separate java projects, server and client.<br>
The server code checks if there exists a path between the points in the graph given by the client file along with drawing the graph. The client file provides an adjacency matrix of the graph too. <br>
The graph is drawn using JUNG 2.1 which needs to be added in the library section of the project in the IDE.
